## File Lister

A simple way to create file lists.

Part of the playground series of repositories.  The playground series are helper classes/apps I wrote, mainly uploaded for posterity.

## Usage

Drag and drop files into the file list area.  Preview items with the inbuilt image previewer.  Right click to remove unwanted files from the list.  When satisfied, export the list to a text file.  Import file lists for editing.

## Input/Output

One file per line, plain-text list(s).  These are usable for input with scripts via for example python's stream reading subsystem or shell scripts.

## Compile

Designed with Qt5 in mind.  Compile with qmake or Qt Creator, and a C++11 compiler.
